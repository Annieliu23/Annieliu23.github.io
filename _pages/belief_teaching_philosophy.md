<h3> <b>Philosophy of Education</b> </h3>
&emsp;My teaching philosophy is built around providing a safe and equitable environment where students can thrive. In my classroom multiple different methods of differentiated instruction will be used to support all types of learners. Visual, auditory, tactile, and kinaesthetic learners will be given the tools to succeed so everyone can achieve. Mental health is also a priority in my classroom. Private polls and sticky note suggestion boxes will be used to report any bullying, difficulties, or needs for extra help. Grades and other confidential information will be protected. I enjoy learning from my students as much as they learn from me. In order to create a strong relationship I believe in transparency and admitting to mistakes I make as a teacher. This way honesty is demonstrated and an emphasis is placed on the importance of learning from our mistakes. 

Students are welcome to be themselves in my classroom. We embrace differences and celebrate all cultures and individualities. The classroom is meant to be diverse and inclusive - multiple resources and celebrations will take place honouring the many cultural holidays throughout the year. Students are always encouraged to become the teacher and share parts of themselves with their classmates whether it be on culture or self identity.
