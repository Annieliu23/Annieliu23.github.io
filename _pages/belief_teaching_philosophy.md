<h3> <b>Philosophy of Education</b> </h3>
&emsp;My teaching philosophy stems from the belief that within the classroom environment teachers learn as much
from students as students learn from teachers. As an educator, I value maintaining a safe and inclusive learning
environment to the best of my ability at all times. This is part of the job, and when provided with this students will
naturally learn from us as teachers and even eachother. I recall a particular scenario that happened during my most
recent practicum. One behavioural student had a violent meltdown and began throwing chairs and other objects
around the room. All of the teachers were at a loss for some time and extremely stressed â€“ but all of the students
seemed to know just to stay out of the way and maintain calm. Although these students were only in kindergarten,
they seemed to understand what to do. I could have learned a thing or two from these kids in the moment. I
assumed that they had witnessed a situation like this before with the special education student in our class; and
learned from the situation. The classroom clearly had become a safe space because students knew to steer away
from the danger and go somewhere else. Mental health is a crucial part of my philosophy of education as well.
This ties into my priority of having a safe space within the classroom where students may go during turbulent
times. Students always maintain the right to pass and student voice is student choice in my classroom.
