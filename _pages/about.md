Hello!

My name is Annie Liu. I am a graduate of [Queen’s University](https://www.queensu.ca/). I obtained my Bachelors of Arts (honours) in 2022 in Theatre and the Dramatic Arts. I am currently still a part of the Queen’s Concurrent Education Program with projected graduation with my Bachelors of Education in August of 2023. I am a teacher candidate in the primary/junior education division with an arts-based learning focus. I love to incorporate arts in the classroom whenever I can and love to provide many music, visual art, and drama cross curricular lessons. I love to dance, sing, and play the ukulele/guitar.

Welcome to my dossier!
