description: 'I joined [Sanctuary AI](https://www.sanctuary.ai/) as a Software Co-op on the Machine Learning team. I worked on object grasping and manipulation using a multi-fingered robotic hand. I implemented a pipeline that would generate and evaluate possible grasps for known objects. The implementation used Numpy and Isaac Gym to take advantage of parallelized computations on the GPU.'
