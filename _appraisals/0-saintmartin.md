description: For my alternative practicum I volunteered at Delmanor Elgin Mills Retirement Residence for 3 weeks. I worked with independent, assisted, and memory plus residents. The memory plus community is a separate living space for residents with Alzheimer's and dementia. I taught art classes and assisted in exercise classes. I also created programs for different celebrations and holidays.
